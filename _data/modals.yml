    - question: What was the first thing you noticed about each other on that first trip?
      answer: >
        <p>I was surprised about how adventurous Fien actually is. I never noticed anything annoying, we think and love the same things. That's also why it works between us. Fien also gets sick very often because of the food. Every time we are traveling somewhere far away, she is vomiting. I am a nurse so I don't mind to clean up the room after, ha!</p>
        <p>I noticed that Elias really took care of me while we were travelling. As said, I get sick very fast, and Elias was always there to help me out and even clean up the room.</p>
    - question: What is the most romantic place you’ve visited together?
      answer: >
        <p>Venice. Venice is a very beautiful place. We went to Venice for a week. A week is quite long to spend in Venice, there are a lot of things you can see and do. But at the end of the week, we were just strolling through the streets. That's why it was so lovely: we had a lot of time to spend with each other, to go out for dinner, eat ice creams laugh with each other... We would like to live in Venice when we are old.</p>
        <p>But there are a lot of other romantic places we have visited together. A city can be very romantic, such as Rome, but being in nature can be very lovely. For example, we spent seven days in Nusa Penida, a little island in Indonesia. There weren't a lot of tourists, we just hired a motorcycle everyday and explored the island. It was very cool to meet locals, spending time at beautiful places and sitting on secret beaches.</p>
    - question: What have you each learnt about travelling together?
      answer: >
        <p>When travelling, you really get to know each other. Travelling is really a good relationship test; you can't hide yourself.</p>
        <p>We also noticed that most of the time it was cheaper for us to sleep in a double bedroom in a hotel than in a hostel. Most of the time it's cheaper to travel as a couple!</p>
    - question: What is it about travelling with a companion that makes you go again and again?
      answer: >
        <p>We are both interested in the same things, and we can find the perfect balance between meeting other people and spending time by ourselves. We both love to travel and explore the world, and without each other, travelling wouldn’t be as fun.</p>
    - question: What would you look for in a romantic break?
      answer: >
        <p>A place where you can spend time with each other. Also that the destination is beautiful – it can be an old city, or it can be a place surrounded by nature. There is a balance between activities and taking it easy. We like strolling through streets, finding beautiful beaches and perfect nature spots. It also is more romantic when the place isn't too crowded.</p>

  questions:
    - question: What are some of the most romantic places you’ve travelled to?
      answer: >
        <p>Most people visiting the UK from abroad focus on London but there's so much more to explore here! In terms of nature Scotland and particularly the Isle of Skye are absolutely amazing! I love going to the Lake District for a couple of days – perfect for a change from hectic city life. There are lots of lovely hotels in the Cotswolds for a romantic weekend getaway too.</p>
        <p>Outside of the UK nothing can beat a weekend in Paris or Venice. It might sound like a cliche but I really find those two cities the most romantic! The best is to avoid the crowds though – don't go to the most touristy places in Paris and visit Venice in winter, when you can enjoy its beauty without crowds of tourists.</p>
    - question: What, in your mind, makes a destination romantic?
      answer: >
        <p>For me remote places are more romantic than crowded ones. As I've lived all my life in big cities I find it really romantic to escape to nature with your loved one.</p>
    - question: What is it about travelling with a companion that makes you go again and again?
      answer: >
        <p>There are always so many discoveries to share and discuss during the trip – it's always great to have your loved one with you so you live through all those experiences together! It makes you more connected and then you have sweet memories for the rest of your lives.</p>
    - question: What inspires you to take out your camera and take a picture?
      answer: >
        <p>It might sound funny but I'm constantly on the lookout for picture opportunities, both in places I've been a million times to and new ones. Sometimes you get tired seeing the same things again and again and in this case travelling helps a lot. You see new country, new people, different colours, taste and smell unusual food and you get inspired again!</p>
    - question: What’s your ideal first date scenario in London?
      answer: >
        <p>There are always so many options in London! If the weather is nice I'd suggest a day trip to Greenwich – Greenwich park is particularly beautiful in spring when cherry trees are in full bloom. You can also explore the Old Royal Naval College or go up the hill to see the Prime Meridian. The view from up there is amazing too! On a rainy day I'd go to Tate Modern and then if weather permits take a stroll along South Bank – this area can get busy but the walk along the Thames is really pretty.</p>

  questions:
    - question: What was the first thing you noticed about each other on that first trip?
      answer: >
        <p>We like to have a lot of fun together when we travel but it was that first trip that showed us both that we love adventure. From the very first trip we took together in Cancun, Mexico, we were always active travellers. This is something we really connected over and we both love to have adventures where we travel and stay active. I can’t imagine trying to travel with someone that doesn’t want to explore and do crazy things.</p>
    - question: What is the most romantic place you’ve visited together?
      answer: >
        <p>To date, the most romantic place we’ve been are the Maldives. We happened to be traveling through that area over Valentine’s Day and the cruise we were on stopped off on islands at night where they shaped hearts in the sand and made candlelit paths. We spent our mornings adventuring under the water with scuba diving, our afternoons enjoying the beaches and our nights on the deck of the boat under the stars.</p>
    - question: What have you each learnt about travelling together?
      answer: >
        <p>We’ve definitely learned to compromise and pay attention to the needs of the other. Travelling can be stressful and sometimes does put a strain on you but it’s nothing that can’t be worked through if you’re mindful of your partner. It’s amazing though how in-sync we have become by sharing experiences and adventures together. We know each other better now than we ever would have prior to travelling together all the time.</p>
    - question: What is it about travelling with a companion that makes you go again and again?
      answer: >
        <p>We’ve really become a dynamic duo when it comes to travelling. We have each other’s back and enjoy sharing our travel experiences together. We know a lot of people travel solo, but we cant imagine how lonely that would be. Even on the longest days travelling, we know we have each other to lean on and that makes hitting the road again much more fun. We also both enjoy the same type of travel, so that provides extra motivation to get out and explore more.</p>
    - question: What would you look for in a romantic break?
      answer: >
        <p>Since we work online, we would look for a place with limited or non-existent internet. This allows us to connect and really enjoy the places we are visiting rather than feeling the need to get caught up on work when we have spare time. We also like dramatic scenery, be it a really great tropical location, a safari in Africa, camping in the jungle or hanging out near mountains. If it’s mind-blowing, it’s romantic to us.</p>
