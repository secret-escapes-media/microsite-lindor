  <p>Rome is a perfect place to go as a couple. At night, the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps impart a wonderfully romantic atmosphere. The Trastevere neighborhood is a great place for an affordable, qualtiy dinner, as it’s a little quieter than the touristy centre of the city. We had a wonderful dinner there for just €10. At sunset, a wonderful spot to relax is the Giardino Storico di Sant Alessio. Get yourself a picnic, and head there during sunset and enjoy your food while you see the sun going down. La vita è bella a Italia!</p>
