  <p>​The Cotswolds is one of my favourite areas to explore pretty little towns, enjoy a meal in a local pub or take a walk along endless fields where sheep are your only neighbours.</p>
  <p>The Cotswolds has been used for many movie locations. For example Bibury, the cutest little village and a popular tourist spot, was one of the locations used in the filming of Stardust. Arlington Row, a group of ancient cottages with steeply pitched roofs, dates back to the 16th century – a time-warp experience for sure.</p>
