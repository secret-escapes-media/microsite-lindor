        <p class="text--lg">Paris is the most romantic city, without doubt (and I’m not just saying that because I’m French!) Me and my partner loved the Passage des Panoramas, a covered walkway with cute restaurants and shops (closed to the Hoxton Hotel), irresistibly charming and perfect for coffee and cake! The view from the top of Galeries Lafayettes is a beautiful spot to steal a kiss, followed by a walk along the Seine and the Canal St Martin hand-in-hand. Classics like lunch in a Parisian brasserie and coffee on the terrace of the Rue Montorgueil are firm favourites, as everything is just so picturesque! Paris is just irresistible romantic.</p>

        <p class="text--lg">Our stay complimented the elegant city perfectly. The Hoxton Hotel, newly opened, seems the place to be in Paris! Only a 15 minute walk from Gare du Nord and a 10 minute walk from Galeries Lafayette, it’s easy to get to the idyllic spots that make Paris such a great destination. The service was incredible – we were warmly welcomed and the staff catered to all our needs. I loved the designed interiors, the bar which had a cool vibe, their irresistible cocktails, and their massive Sunday brunch!</p>

        <p class="text--lg">We were also lucky enough to be invited to Lindt Opera, Lindt’s flagship store in Paris. Whilst there, the Maitre Chocolatier let us carefully select our own ingredients to create a personalised chocolate bar just for us! It was the perfect treat to sweeten our romantic getaway.</p>
